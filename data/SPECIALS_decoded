SPECIALS

event -
(what triggers the special's activation
)
	summon (this card summoned)
	summon-neighbor - (neighbor (either) is summoned)
	summon-sibling - (my sibling is summoned)

	owner-turn-start
	owner-turn-end (?)
	opponent-turn-start
	opponent-turn-end(?)

	attack (this card attacks) (?)
	neighbor-attack (?)
	sibling-attack (?)
	across-attack (?)
	opponent-creature-attack(?)

	defend-self (this card defends)
	owner-defend (owner is attacked)
	neighbor-defend (neighbor is attacked)
	sibling-defend (?)

	die
	neighbor-die (?)
	sibling-die (?)
	across-die (?)
	opponen-creature-die (?)

	cast (this spell-card is cast)
	owner-cast (my owner is casting a spell-card)


target - 
(whom special is acting upon)

	owner
	self
	neighbors
	siblings

	opponent
	across
	opponent-creatures

	all-creatures


effect -
(what property gets affected)

	If Effect string is "powers", expect amount to be an array of values for each power.

	If Effect is string, look for target["effect"] property, where effect is property keyword.
		eg. cardX['attack'] or playerX['hp']

	If that property doesn't exist on that target, check effect string against code words, such as...
	"damage" - in the context of modifying spells, the special modifies the damage of the currently cast spell.
	** - Yet to finalize how "damage" gets applied
	-- "damage" modifies damage from "owner-cast" event.  

	On "defend-" event, these effects modify damage before it is applied.
	"nonphysical-percent" - reduces nonphysical damage by percent defined in amount
	"physical-percent" - " physical " " "
	"nonphysical-amount" - reduces nonphysical damage by amount
	"physical-amount" - " physical " " "


amount - 
(what amount gets applied to affected property)

	Number, array or string.





//==============================================
When a creature attacks, or a spell (attack spell) is cast,
1) find target/s
2) determine damage
3) modify damage by "attack" events
4) modigy damage by "defend" events
5) apply damage


BUG REPORT:
_______________________

√ -  minotaur-boosted attacks do not drop back to normal immidiately when minotaur dies.

√ - When Giant Spider is cast (while minotaur on the board), GS gets attack bonus, but it's Forest Spiders do not.
√	Now one Forest Spider gets 2 attack boosts, but other gets none.

√ - Hydra does no damage.

√ - Ice Guard is causing fractional damage (should be rounded).  
√ - Ice Guard is affecting teammate cards' incoming damage, not just damage to Player

√ - Lightning Bolt is adding damage rather than subtracting

√ - Rejuvenation is subtracting hp rather than adding


√ - Nature's Fury: No solution yet. - wrote a custom function

√ - Fire Elemental's attack is not increasing with Fire power.  Instead, it appears to be getting added as a string.
√ - Water Elemental same.

√ - Phoenix's attack jumped to 16. 
√ - When a creature is played, it takes on Fire Elemental's HP at that turn 
    : enqueueSummonPhaseSpecials had been making the summoned card teh target of summon-sibling, regardless of Fire Elemental specifying "self"



√ - Inferno wouldnt let me choose Target of my choice.  Accepted my 4th choice.  And only did 10 damage each
√ - Targeted spells don't let me select all legal targets sometimes
	:jquery's .off() was the culprit

√ - Call to Thunder can't choose some creatures for Target (human player's move)
√ - Call to Thunder auto-chose Target creature for human player
√ - Then AI creatures attacked themselves
	:had if activePlayer = computerPlayer, rather than ==

√ - * AI Call to Thunder highlights my cards, rather than picking one itself...
√ - But then another time, AI chose target itself

√ - When Forest Sprite has attack boosted (by Orc Chieftain, eg), it still only does 1 point damage to enemies


√ - If player is killed by a spell, game doesn't end until an attack is made.

√ - When AI has Ice Guard in play, my Forest Sprite (boosted to 3 attack by Orc Chieftain), still does 3 damage to AIPlayer.

- in Game.executeSpecial(), when checkSpecialDefend gets applied, how do we know if attack is physical or nonPhysical?

√ - Phoenix gets 16 hp when it dies (and player's powers@0 >= 10), but doesn't come back to life.


√ - Tornado does not destroy target creature, and doesn't continue to next player turn.
	:fixed with magic AmountString.  Added "target" to ref switch in decoder function Game.specialGetStringamountAmount

√ - Placing Forest Sprite after Minotaur Commander, Forest Sprite attack did not increase.
√ - First card on rack gets the boost instead.
	:ugly hack in Game.enqueueSummonPhaseSpecials


√ - Lightning cloud doesn't damage Ice Golem.  It should (Physical attack)
	:specials now have special.isNonPhysical

√ - Ice Guard doesn't halve Wall of Lightning damage
	:added checkDefend call in execute special

- Cards in deck and in rack have shadows overlapping.

√ - Master Healer is not healing itself.



FEATURE REQUESTS:
_______________________


- If no card can be played, AI needs to skip turn.  Also need option for Human to skp turn.

- WHen cards "flex" to show they're executing special, make them take turns

- AI needs to pick card for spells requiring target-creature
